This example demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript where type errors are not caught at compile time. When using the '+' operator with a number and a string, the compiler doesn't throw an error, but unexpected runtime behavior will occur, such as string concatenation instead of addition. This issue can lead to hard-to-debug runtime errors.
